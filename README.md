# Qcomm

## About
Welcome to Qcomm, a simulation tool designed to assess the impact
of communication on the performance of scalable multi-core
quantum architectures. Qcomm allows users to adjust various
architectural and physical parameters of the system, and outputs
various communication metrics.

## Publications
We introduced the first version of Qcomm and used it to conduct a preliminary study on how various parameters influence communication performance in a multi-core quantum system. The results of this study were presented in the following publication:

Maurizio Palesi, Enrico Russo, Davide Patti, Giuseppe Ascia, and Vincenzo Catania, "_Assessing the Role of Communication in Scalable Multi-Core Quantum Architectures_," in _2024 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSoC)_, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 2024, pp. 482-489, doi: 10.1109/MCSoC64144.2024.00085.

If you use Qcomm in your research, we kindly ask you to cite the above publication in any related work.
